# SushiBits LightSwitch-USB

This is a simple-ish USB-controlled LED light switch, intended to be used along
with IKEA USB powered LED lights.

For me this gadget is intended to play nice with my KVM tree, which would share
the LED Lamp (along with other peripherals) across computers. This is one of the
reason why a custom USB device is needed, since being a full USB device would
allow the computer, and the software running on it, to tell if the LED is online
or not. It also tells whether the computer is active on KVM or not.
